[[Swarm_Mode]]
= Deploy Application using Swarm Mode

Docker Engine 1.12 includes swarm mode for natively managing a cluster of Docker Engines called a Swarm. Use the Docker CLI to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm behavior. Complete details at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/. It's important to understand the https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/[Swarm mode key concepts] of Swarm, Node, Service, Task and Load Balancing.

Swarm is typically a cluster of multiple Docker Engines. But for simplicity we'll run a single node Swarm.

This section will deploy an application that will provide a CRUD/REST interface on a data bucket in http://developer.couchbase.com/server[Couchbase]. This is achieved by using a Java EE application deployed on http://wildfly.org[WildFly] to access the database.

== Initialize a Swarm

Initialize Swarm mode using the following command:

    docker swarm init

This starts a Swarm Manager. By default, manager node are also worker but can be configured to be manager-only.

Find some information about this one-node cluster using the command `docker info`

This cluster has 1 node, and that is a manager.

== Start Application using Docker Compose

Create a new directory and `cd` to it:

    mkdir compose-swarm
    cd compose-swarm

Create a new Compose definition using the configuration file shown below.

[source, text]
----
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    image: couchbase
    ports:
      - 8091:8091

      - 8093:8093 
      - 11210:11210
  web:

    environment:
      - COUCHBASE_URI=db
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9990:9990
----

In this Compose file:

. `couchbase` image is used for Couchbase server.
. `arungupta/wildfly-admin` image is used as it binds WildFlyâ€™s management to all network interfaces, and in addition also exposes port 9990. This enables WildFly Maven Plugin to be used to deploy the application.

This application can be started as:

    docker-compose up -d

This shows the output as:

WildFly and Couchbase containers are started on this node. If the Swarm cluster has multiple nodes then the containers will be started on different nodes based upon default `spread` strategy.

A new overlay network is created. This allows multiple containers on different hosts to communicate with each other.

== Verify Containers in Application

Connect to the Swarm cluster and verify that WildFly and Couchbase are running using `docker-compose ps`:

== Configure Couchbase server

Clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/couchbase-javaee.git. This workspace contains a simple Java EE application that is deployed on WildFly and provides a REST API over a sample bucket in Couchbase.

Couchbase server can be configured using http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/rest-api/rest-endpoints-all.html[Couchbase REST API]. The application contains a Maven profile that configures the Couchbase server, loads the `travel-sample` bucket, and creates an empty bucket. This can be invoked as:

mvn install -Pcouchbase -Ddocker.host=localhost

== Deploy Application

Deploy the application to WildFly by specifying three parameters:

. Host IP address where WildFly is running (`localhost` in this example)
. Username of a user in WildFly's administrative realm
. Password of the user specified in WildFly's administrative realm

== Access Application

Now that the WildFly and Couchbase servers have been configured, let's access the application. You need to specify IP address of the host where WildFly is running (`localhost` in our case).

The endpoint can be accessed in this case as:

    curl http://localhost:8080/couchbase-javaee/resources/airline

The output is shown as:
